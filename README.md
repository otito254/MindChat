Scripts used

1st Script:
Objective: Identify and analyze gaps, challenges, or unmet needs within SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and SDG 4 (Quality Education) that could be addressed through innovative technology solutions — specifically mobile apps or web applications.
Instructions:
For each SDG, examine existing solutions in the target region(s) and highlight shortcomings, accessibility issues, underserved demographics, or operational inefficiencies.
Prioritize gaps where digital technology could have high impact with reasonable feasibility.
Propose at least three technology-based concepts per SDG, detailing:
Gap Statement: What’s missing, ineffective, or inaccessible right now
Proposed Solution: An outline of the app/web application idea
Core Features: Specific functionalities to address the gap
Target Users: Who will benefit most
Impact Pathway: How the solution drives progress toward the SDG target
Consider constraints such as low connectivity, multilingual needs, data privacy, and inclusivity.
Provide real-world examples (if any exist) and explain how your concept improves upon them.
Format output as:
Separate sections for SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 4
Tables or bullet points for each idea
Concise but data-backed descriptions

Technology stack

Layer
Recommendation
Why It Works Well for Low Bandwidth
Frontend
HTML + CSS + minimal vanilla JS
No heavy frameworks → smaller payloads, faster parse times
Backend
Static hosting (e.g., AWS S3, Netlify, GitHub Pages) or a tiny server (Node.js with Express or Go)
Static sites require no server‑side rendering on each request, reducing latency
Data
JSON files or a lightweight API with batched responses
Avoids multiple round trips; easy to cache
Media
Optimized images (WebP/AVIF), compressed SVGs, no auto‑playing videos
Cuts asset size dramatically
Delivery
CDN (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront)
Serves content from the nearest edge location for speed
Offline Support
Service Worker (PWA)
Caches critical assets for instant reloads even with poor connectivity
